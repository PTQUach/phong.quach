## About me: 
Hi, I’m Phong Quach and I am a Vietnamese international junior undergraduate majoring in Business Data Analytics and Computer Information Systems.

I have a wide range of interests and hobbies that keep me engaged and excited about life. I love working out 🏋️‍♂️ to stay fit and healthy, and baking 🍰 allows me to get creative in the kitchen. Photography 📸 is a passion of mine, capturing moments and turning them into memories. I enjoy thrifting 🛍️, finding unique items and resell them on Depop. Coding 💻 is another significant interest, as it allows me to solve problems and create new things.

As an ENFP 🌟, I thrive on exploring new ideas, connecting with people, and embracing the adventures that life offers.
